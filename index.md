Hi, I'm Eric Nishio and I specialize in **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **CSS**, and
**HTML**. When I'm not developing web apps I like to study Mandarin Chinese,
play guitar, and read books. Some of the tools and technologies I like to use
are:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

I speak and write fluent **English**, **Finnish**, and **Japanese**, and I can also
converse in **Mandarin Chinese** and **Swedish**.

I believe in minimalism and in being a Jack of All Trades, Master of Many.
