Hi, I'm Eric Nishio and I specialize in *JavaScript*, *Node.js*, *CSS*, and
*HTML*. When I'm not developing web apps I like to study Mandarin Chinese,
play guitar, and read books. Some of the tools and technologies I like to use
are:

- AngularJS
- Sails
- Sass
- Gulp
- Twitter Bootstrap

I speak and write fluent *English*, *Finnish*, and *Japanese*, and I can also
converse in *Mandarin Chinese* and *Swedish*.

I believe in minimalism and the
[80â€“20 principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).
