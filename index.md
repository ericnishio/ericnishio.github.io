Hi, I'm Eric Nishio and I specialize in **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **CSS**, and
**HTML**. When I'm not developing web apps I like to study Mandarin Chinese,
play guitar, and read books. Some of the tools and technologies I like to use
are:

- React
- Redux
- AngularJS
- Sails.js
- Sass
- MongoDB
- Foundation

I speak and write fluent **English**, **Finnish**, and **Japanese**, and I can also
converse in **Mandarin Chinese** and **Swedish**.

I believe in minimalism and in being a Jack of All Trades, Master of Many.
